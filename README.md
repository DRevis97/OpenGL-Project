# OpenGL-Project
Renderer project made with OpenGL
This Renderer was made thanks to Joey de Vries's excellent LearnOpenGL tutorials: https://learnopengl.com/
If you cannot run the code, please refer to that website on how to build and run GLFW and Assimp, and download my code. I am working on fixing
it to where anyone can run it. I did use Visual Studio 2017 to build and run the project.
